# Pacman_Final_Project
This is the final project I wrote for CS140 Intro to Python Programming. It is a simpler version of pacman, keeping its essence, the player controls pacman with joystick mile motions, with the arrow keys, and collects points while avoiding the ghosts, which each has a different AI configuration.

The code was mostly done using pygame, for making the visuals and commands of the game. As well as support from math, and copy functions.

The project was solely done by me, except for character designs(ghosts and pacman)
